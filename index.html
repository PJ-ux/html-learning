    <p style="color:red ; text-align: center;"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has<br>
         been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took<br>
          a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only <br>
          five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially <br>
          unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing<br> 
          Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus <br>
          PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
